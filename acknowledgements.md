# ABLeS acknowledgement statement

The ABLeS program should be both cited and acknowledged in any publication, presentation or grant application. 

1. Cite the ABLeS program in any publication, presentation or grant application that was supported by data or services provided by the ABLeS and cite the ABLeS publication (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6342352).

2. Use the following acknowledgement statement:
"The authors acknowledge the provision of computing and data resources provided by the Australian BioCommons Leadership Share (ABLeS) program. This program is co-funded by NCRIS, the National Computational Infrastructure and Pawsey Supercomputing Centre.‚Äù

# ABLeS co-author policy

In some cases, it may be appropriate for ABLeS, the NCI or Pawsey support specialists to be co-authors on publications. Examples of this include when these specialists provide significant input into the publication, including a significant contribution to method / protocol / pipeline development, study design, data and results analysis, or interpretation.

Authorship is NOT expected for routine / simple services provided (e.g. tool installation) and an acknowledgement is sufficient in these cases. We approach authorship issues with a generous spirit and aim to fairly attribute contributions.
