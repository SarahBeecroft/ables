# Frequently Asked Questions

## How much resource will my jobs on Gadi consume?

The cost of running jobs on GADI is measured by service units (SU). The number of USs used by a job can vary based on two main factors:
1. The amount of walltime used by the job. 
2. The resources reserved for the job.

## What happens to service units (SUs) that aren’t consumed in a given quarter?

The allocation of SUs is on a quarterly basis. At the beginning of each quarter, Biocommons will allocate 100 kSU of computational resources to each community. Additional resources will be allocated according to the quarterly plan proposed by the community, as well as the resources still available in that quarter. 

Communities should utilise the allocated SUs:
1. For projects approved by the steering committee. 
2. Using the tools, methods and/or workflows that are suited to their community requirements.
3. While making sure to consider that the allocation is a shared resource for their community (if in doubt, consult with your community bioinformatics lead, or the BioCommons)

Communities can request additional resources when needed through the following form ([link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaJdpQXbvXYfjwXFRPAmtc0FjJEcCwplM7kCWye1DFMtgx9g/viewform?usp=sf_link)), if the quarterly plan did not accurately predict resource requirements. 
Unused SUs can NOT be rolled-over to the next quarter. As ABLeS is a shared resource covering many communities, it is therefore expected that each community will adopt a best-effort approach to firstly estimate their computational requirement realistically and accurately, and also actively manage the allocations which are provided (i.e. don’t waste your allocation, as the resource is still finite). 

## How do I submit a work plan for the quarter to the BioCommons team?
The Australian BioCommons has a GoogleForm available that allows you to submit the quarterly plan for your community.

You can also submit the following using the same GoogleForm: 
Additional resource request (beyond the quarterly plan allocation)
General feedback
Installation request for the `Australian BioCommons Tools and Workflows project`, also known as project allocation `if89`
