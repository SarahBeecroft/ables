# Resources available for ABLeS communities

## Computational resources

ABLeS encompasses 16 million service units (SUs) of compute capacity and 500 TB of storage available per annum on the [Gadi supercomputer at the NCI](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems). These SUs can be utilised to run jobs on different nodes of GADI that are equipped with either CPUs or GPUs. 

Details on GADI’s resources are available at https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems. 

Details on the GADI’s storage system are available [here](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/storage-systems).

ABLes computational resources are allocated to each community according to the quarterly plan submitted by the bioinformatics lead of the community. Additional resources can be requested through the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaJdpQXbvXYfjwXFRPAmtc0FjJEcCwplM7kCWye1DFMtgx9g/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## Centrally supported tools and software through NCI (`/apps`)

Details about software available through NCI are available [here ](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/5.+Software+Applications)

## Shared repository of tools and software

ABLeS communities have access to the `Australian BioCommons Tools and Workflows project`, in project allocation `if89`. which is a repository of popular tools and workflows that can be utilised directly by communities members without any need to install them or maintain them. A list of these tools and workflows is available below:

As a member of any ABLeS community, you get access to this shared repository. Communities can contribute to this shared repository and add more tools that will be shared with others.



# Specialist expertise
ABLeS’s communities are supported by NCI, Pawsey and ABLeS specialists to install, develop, optimise and deploy tools and workflows on ABLeS projects.
