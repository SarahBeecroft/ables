## Computational resources

ABLeS encompasses 16 million service units (SUs) of compute capacity and 500 TB of storage available per annum on the [Gadi supercomputer at the NCI](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems). These SUs can be utilised to run jobs on different nodes of GADI that are equipped with either CPUs or GPUs. 

Details on:
- [Gadi resources available](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems) 
- [Gadi storage system](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/storage-systems).

ABLes computational resources are allocated to each community according to the quarterly plan submitted by the bioinformatics lead of the community.

## Centrally supported tools and software through NCI (`/apps`)

Details about software available through NCI are available [here ](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/5.+Software+Applications)

## Shared repository of tools and software

ABLeS communities have access to the `Australian BioCommons Tools and Workflows project`, in project allocation `if89`.
This is a repository of popular tools, containers and workflows that can be used by 
anyone in the NCI user community.
Anyone from an NCI community can contribute to `if89` and add more tools that will be shared with others.

A list of these tools and workflows is available below (2022-04-13):

# Specialist expertise
ABLeSâ€™s communities are supported by NCI, Pawsey and ABLeS specialists to install, develop, optimise and deploy tools and workflows on ABLeS projects.
